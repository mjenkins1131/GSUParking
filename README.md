GSU Parking Lot

This group will be tasked with designing hardware and software solutions to help the Georgia Southern Parking Office 
keep track of the vehicles entering and exiting each lot at any given time. The Parking Office will then be able to 
use this data to determine whether expansion is needed as well as be able to determine the busiest times at each lot.

The SEFall2018 folder contains the most up to date website.
